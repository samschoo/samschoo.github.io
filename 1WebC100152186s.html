                Cuddles is a 13 year old female cat which my family has had since
                near her birth. She has been a wonderful addition to the family who 
                spreads joy and affection with her wherever her travels take her.
                <br>Here is a photo of her in action!
            </p>

                She has a very exciting life around our house. Some of her favourite
                activities include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>sleeping</li>
                <li>eating</li>
                <li>relaxing in the sun</li>
            </ul>

                Our family has had a total of 3 cats, but only Cuddles has stuck 
                it out this long:

            <table border="1">
                <tr>
                    <th>Order</th>
                    <th>Cat Name</th>
                    <th>Passed?</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>1st</td>
                    <td>Baby</td>
                    <td>Yes</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>2nd</td>
                    <td>Cuddles</td>
                    <td>No</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>3rd</td>
                    <td>Puddles</td>
                    <td>Yes</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p>
                And we hope she can stick it out for many years longer!
